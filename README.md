# DuneBuggyAR
A cross platform digital AR Toy. This project started as a quick demo for Lens Studio and experienced massive scope creep as we kept porting to other platforms. WARNING: some of the projects are a thrown together in a messy way. If we were to do it again we would change a ton of stuff. With that said. It's free! Take it, extend it, make a commercial project... whatever you feel like doing. If along the way you clean up our project structures please submit a pull request and we'll update the repo for everyone to enjoy.

# Project setup

`npm install` will install the required dependencies

`npm run watch` will compile all of the shared code within the `shared` folder and will write `shared.js` within each separate project folder.

Each individual project may have their own sets of dependencies which can be install inside of their subdirectory.

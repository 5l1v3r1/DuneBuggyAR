# Dune Buggy AR - Spark AR

This folder contains the project files for the SparkAR version which can be used to create a Facebook and Instagram filter. `/scripts/shared.js` is created by running `npm run watch` in the repo's root directory.

Within the `/scripts` folder you'll want to run `node ./watch.js` which is used to combine `main.js` and `shared.js` into `script.js`. This is due to the fact that SparkAR currently only supports using a single javascript file and I found it easier to keep my code in seperate files while working.
